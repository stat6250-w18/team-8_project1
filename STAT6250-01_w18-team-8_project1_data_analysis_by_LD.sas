[Research Question 1] Use the longitude and latitude data to make the map, 
visualize the data to find out where the places the incidents most likely 
occurred are? 

(Rationale: Data visualization is a good choice for storytelling especially when
we have longitude and latitude data, we could make the map to understand the data
better.)

[Research Question 2] List the air carriers who have the top number of incidents? 

(Rationale: Fly safely is the top concern to the customers, this can help the 
customer to avoid the air companies have the higher number of incidents.) 

[Research Question 3] Is there any correlation between the weather condition and 
the event?

(Rationale: Weather condition is an important factor for the flight safety, but 
with the help of the modern technologies, the airplane is controlled by the 
computer most of the time, is there still any strong relationship between the 
weather condition and the incidents by the time?)
 
[Reason for Choice] The NTSB aviation accident database have the information from
1962 to Dec 2017 relating to the civil aviation accidents and incidents happened
within the U.S. territories. We can use it to do an exploratory data analysis, 
to answer some questions we are interested in, and to help us to avoid the air 
carriers with a higher number of incidents occurred, and to help the aviation 
industry to improve the quality.
